						CURATION / RESEARCH INITIATIVES

						<p>
							Overview of a Work in Progress (O-WIP) was a group project I initiated in the spring of 2015 to develop and experiment with the idea of an evolving, collective-based, research practice. Using a series of short stories that I wrote as a starting point for discussion, weekly meetings were held to both share research material and refocus group discussions that eventually led to the completion of two small bodies of work.

						<p class="section-heading">
							O-WIP Part 2: Completed Jan. 2016
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Spatial experience, visualization, and interaction are being redefined as new technologies are introduced into the global marketplace. As an outcome, the digital landscape is occupied with fragments of the physical world and vice versa. A tension rising between two disparate planes of experience begins to both inform and confuse methods of production and presentation. With this in mind, our work seeks to offer a space of speculation, contemplation, and application.
